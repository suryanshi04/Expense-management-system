# Expense-management-system
People do not have a track on their monthly expenses and receivables and they do not have any control on what they spend. Developing an application which will be able to keep track on expenses and receivables can solve this problem. To manage our monthly expenses we designed an application. Whatever we spend on monthly or daily basis will be recorded in this application. And it is used to manage our monthly expenses. User can enter their limited budget of the entire month in this application where when the user exceeds their given budget in the respective month, they will be notified through Expense Management System Application. And also some mathematical calculations are done to calculate the expenditure on what items users spend a lot and users will be notified that they are spending a lot of amount on the respective item so that they can reduce their expenditure on that item in future. We created this application using Python, the interface was created using GUI (tkinter).
Keywords â€“ tkinter, Python, GUI
